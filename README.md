# E-commerce Back End 

## Description

Thanks for visiting! This is back end for an e-commerce site using an Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This project showcases the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned my repo to your machine you will need to run "npm run seeds" to seed the database, then run "node server.js" to connect to the database. Open up Insomnia Core to test the functionality of the application. You need to use POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core for each.

- GET routes to return all categories, all products, and all tags
- GET routes to return a single category, a single product, and a single tag
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories
- POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for products and tags
